# AIYouCanSay
This is a **Robot Chat Group**! We realize the connection between multiple **Discord** chatbots and **OpenAI ChatGPT API**/**Google Gemini API**.

You can use it as a group chat of multiple specialists with your **ceativity** and appropriate **prompts**.
**In this case, you can communicate with multiple LLMs in different expertise simultaneously in Discord**!
You **DO NOT** need to switch windows to get answers from different perspectives.
